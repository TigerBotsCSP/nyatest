Testing repository for Nyahiito because they still have offseason to go through (maybe not)

`nyatest` includes autonomous pathways using voltage curving for testing. You can open up the old NCP Lite files to get connected. The original NCP program will not work because NCP Lite is way better. NyaDS **does not** have any curving edits, but that'll be quick to add if we want to test that. We'll probably stick with NyaDS for pathways since that's a lot quicker to use.

Overall, this repository will get discarded if swerve drive is ready for offseason events, and that's likely to happen. If that happens, assuming we'll default to NyaDS for autonomous on swerve (NyaDS is also easier to add to the swerve project's code), NyaDS will get the curving edits so our arm can move accurately. To be honest, we should test the curving first to see if it even makes a difference. If it does, great! If it doesn't...at least it's offseason
